          Hi, I'm David Watson! <img src="./html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px" />
        </h1>
        <p>
          I am an IT and SaaS client support specialist transitioning into cloud development. I'm currently taking the
          IBM Full Stack Cloud Developer program to assist with this transition. I have 5 years of experience in
          providing IT support services, comprising 2 years of help desk at the enterprise level, and 3 years customized
          support at both the consumer and non-profit levels. My cloud experience is mainly with Microsoft Azure
          including using AzureAD.
          <br />
          <br />
          My software development experience has so far been personal with a mix of hobby and individual
          work projects. For these projects, I have mainly used Python, PowerShell, and JSON. To a lesser extent, I have
          also worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
